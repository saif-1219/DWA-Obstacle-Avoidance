Hybrid RRT* & DWA Path Planner for MATLABA robust autonomous navigation simulation that combines *RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star)** for global path planning with DWA (Dynamic Window Approach) for local reactive collision avoidance.📖 OverviewThis project simulates a mobile robot navigating a maze. It solves the navigation problem in two layers:*Global Layer (RRT):** Finds an asymptotically optimal path through static map geometry (walls).Local Layer (DWA): Tracks the global path while dynamically avoiding new, unforeseen obstacles and respecting kinematic constraints (velocity, acceleration).✨ Key FeaturesInteractive Setup: User-defined Start and Goal positions using mouse clicks.Dynamic Environment: Allows the user to inject dynamic obstacles after the global path is planned to test the DWA's reactivity.*RRT Optimization:** Uses rewiring to find a shorter path than standard RRT.Stabilized Control: tuned DWA gain parameters to prevent oscillation.Safety Zones: Visualizes the "safety radius" used by the planner to treat narrow gaps as closed walls.Lookahead Tracking: Implements a "carrot-chasing" logic to smooth trajectory tracking.🚀 UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/dwa-rrt-star-matlab.git
cd dwa-rrt-star-matlab
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder.Run the script:Matlabdwa_rrt_star_stable
Follow the Interactive Prompts:Step 1: Left-click on the map to set the Start position.Step 2: Right-click on the map to set the Goal position.(Wait for the Green Global Path to generate)Step 3: Left-click anywhere to add Dynamic Obstacles (Red squares).Step 4: Right-click to Start the Simulation.🧠 Algorithm Details1. Global Planner: RRT*The RRT* algorithm builds a tree of possible paths. Unlike standard RRT, it rewires nodes when a shorter path to the start is found, ensuring the path converges toward the optimal solution over $k$ iterations.2. Local Planner: DWAThe Dynamic Window Approach samples a window of feasible velocities $(v, \omega)$ based on the robot's current state and acceleration limits. It maximizes an objective function $G(v, \omega)$:$$G(v, \omega) = \alpha \cdot \text{heading}(v, \omega) + \beta \cdot \text{dist}(v, \omega) + \gamma \cdot \text{vel}(v, \omega)$$Where:Heading: Measures alignment with the target point on the global path.Dist: Distance to the nearest obstacle (static or dynamic).Vel: Preference for higher speeds.⚙️ ConfigurationYou can tune the robot's behavior by modifying the config struct at the top of dwa_rrt_star_stable.m:ParameterDefaultDescriptionmax_speed1.0Maximum linear velocity (m/s)max_yaw_rate50 deg/sMaximum angular velocityrrt_max_iter2000Max iterations for RRT* tree growthpredict_time2.0DWA prediction horizon (seconds)safe_dist0.8Buffer distance to consider a gap "closed"goal_tolerance0.5Distance to accept "Goal Reached"📂 File Structuredwa_rrt_star_stable.m - The main entry point containing the loop, plotting, and all logic classes.Includes local functions: rrt_star_planner, dwa_control, motion_model, etc.📸 Screenshots(You should take a screenshot of your MATLAB figure after running it and upload it here)🤝 ContributingPull requests are welcome.
